## How to Play

Playing is simple and fun and just like the riders doing battle on the track, score the most points and you win! Here’s how:

1. Sign up and create your account.
2. Enter and/or create a Private League and compete against your friends for bragging rights and/or pay to enter our Championship League and compete to win event prizes and track season points standings to win series prizes.
   - Only points earned after joining the Championship League count towards your championship points.
   - To be eligible for the combined (SX & MX) season grand prize, you must play both Supercross & Motocross Championship Leagues.
   - Supercross Championship League cost is $24.99. (counts as 1 entry in drawing for Grand National season grand prize)
   - Motocross Championship League cost is $19.99. (counts as 1 entry in drawing for Grand National season grand prize)
   - SuperMotocross Championship League cost is $9.99. (counts as 1 entry in drawing for Grand National season grand prize)
   - Sign up for the Supercross, Motocross, and SuperMotocross Championship Leagues prior to lockout at the first Supercross race of the season and pay $39.99 and save $15. (counts as 2 entries in drawing for Grand National season grand prize)
3. Enter a Single Race event and compete to win prizes for that event only.
   - Supercross Single Race cost is $2.99.
   - Motocross Single Race cost is $2.99.
   - SuperMotocross Single Race cost is $2.99.
4. Pick your team. Teams will consist of 4 riders in the 450cc class and 4 riders in the 250cc class.
5. You will not be allowed to pick the same riders consecutive events in the same series.
6. You must select all 8 riders at once in order for your team to save.
   - One (1) rider on your 450 team and one (1) rider on your 250 team must be a single-points paying rider; designated in the game as an “All-Star.”
   - All other riders (non All-Stars) are eligible for double points, but only when they finish 10th or better (with their handicap applied). If any rider finishes 11th or worse, they will receive normal points for that position.
   - You also have the option to choose a rider who will be "First to the Finish Line" or FFL. This would be the rider that is leading the race when riders cross the finish line for the very first time, per official timing and scoring (NOTE: IN SOME CASES THIS WILL NOT BE THE FIRST OFFICIAL LAP). All succeeding references to lap 1 regarding this option are to be considered the first to cross the finish line the first time, while still being referred to as "Lap 1". (Amended: August 12, 2019 for clarification)
     - Reward for correctly choosing a rider for "First to the Finish Line" will add 15 points to your event total.
     - Penalty for incorrectly choosing a rider for "First to the Finish Line" will subtract 7 points from your event total.
     - By not choosing a rider for "First to the Finish Line", 0 points will be added or subtracted from your event total.
     - For events where a “Triple Crown” race format is used, your chosen rider only needs to be "First to the Finish Line" in one of the 3 races to add 15 points to your total event score. Points will not be awarded for multiple races; a maximum of 15 points per class can be earned.
     - For race events where a “Triple Crown” race format is used, and your chosen rider fails to be "First to the Finish Line" in at least 1 of the 3 races, 7 points will be subtracted from your total event score. A maximum of 7 points per class, for a total of 14 points, can be lost.
7. Save your team. You only need to save one team; it applies to all leagues you’ve joined.
8. Score the most points and you win. If you have paid to play in our Championship League and you score enough points to rank within the prize-winning positions, you will win the designated event prize for your rank for that event.

## Handicaps

All riders will be labeled with a handicap value for each event. This is a value that will be applied to the riders’ event finish to determine their points paying finish within the fantasy game. Handicaps can have positive (+) values or negative (-) values. Handicaps are determined by PulpMX Fantasy admin team and will be posted soon after event entry lists become available. Handicap values will be applied automatically for you in game scoring.

## Triple Crown Handicaps

Rider handicaps for Triple Crown events may differ in value and process from rider handicaps at non Triple Crown events. For example, while max handicaps at normal SX events are 16, they may be maxed at a lower number for a Triple Crown event.

You would calculate handicap values as follows:

- Cole Seely - All Star - (+2) - Cole has a handicap value of positive 2. Cole finishes 4th. To correctly apply his handicap, you would move Cole up 2 positions. Cole’s points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 2nd.
- Marvin Musquin - All Star - (-1) - Marvin has a handicap value of negative 1. Marvin finishes 4th. To correctly apply his handicap, you would move Marvin back 1 position. Marvin’s points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 5th.
- Eli Tomac - All Star - (0) - Eli has a handicap value of 0. Eli finishes 4th. To correctly apply his handicap, you would not move Eli any positions. Eli’s points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 4th.
- Justin Bogle (+6) - Justin has a handicap value of positive 6. Justin finishes 11th. To correctly apply his handicap, you would move Justin up 6 positions. Justin’s points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 5th.
- Vince Friese (+11) - Vince has a handicap value of positive 11. Vince finishes 22nd. To correctly apply his handicap, you would move Vince up 11 positions. Vince's points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 11th.

## Scoring (Event)

Scoring will be calculated by adding all points earned for all chosen riders, including their handicap values, for each team, in each class, in each league. Points are awarded based on a rider's official position with their handicap applied.

## Scoring (Triple Crown)

Fantasy scores will be calculated based on a rider's overall Triple Crown position and not per race. Provisional Live Scoring will update live throughout all races, but is still calculated based on current overall position instead of current position in the race currently running.

## Scoring (Motocross)

Fantasy scores will be awarded per moto based on finishing position with handicap applied.

### Scoring Examples

- Cole Seely - All Star - (+2) - Cole finishes 4th. Cole's points paying finish in the fantasy game is 2nd. Cole would be awarded 23 points in Supercross and 22 points in Motocross (for that moto).
- Marvin Musquin - All Star - (-1) - Marvin finishes 4th. Marvin's points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 5th. Marvin would be awarded 18 points in Supercross and 16 points in Motocross (for that moto).
- Eli Tomac - All Star - (0) - Eli finishes 4th. Eli's points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 4th. Eli would be awarded 19 points in Supercross and 18 points in Motocross (for that moto).
- Justin Bogle (+6) - Justin finishes 11th. Justin's points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 5th. Because Justin is NOT an All Star, his points earned would be doubled, but only because he finished 10th or better with his handicap applied. Justin would be awarded 36 points in Supercross and 32 points in Motocross (for that moto).
- Vince Friese (+11) - Vince finishes 22nd. Vince's points paying finish in the fantasy game would be 11th. Because his finish with handicap applied is not 10th or better, his point will not be doubled. Vince would be awarded 12 points in Supercross and 10 points in Motocross (for that moto).
